3 level game with obstacle course and treasure hunt

Unity 3D Game using C# and graphics from the Unity Asset Store. This game consists of 3 levels: level 1 is an obstacle course and level 2 and 3 are treasure hunts. The objective of level 1 is to reach the end of the course without getting killed by enemies. The objective of level 2 and 3 is to find all items without getting killed by the enemies. The difference between level 2 and level 3 is that in level 3, enemies spawn every certain time period and chase the user, unlike in level 2, where enemies are static or move only within their set boundaries.
